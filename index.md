## Alexander Detkov
Hello, my name is Alex, and I'm currently in the final year of my undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics and Mathematics at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca). I am interested in making deep learning more trustworthy and robust by incorporating symbolic reasoning, interpretability, and inductive biases. I am also very excited about AI-driven scientific discovery in the natural sciences. Ultimately, I wish to work and contribute towards a cognitive "System 2" artificial intelligence.

Currently, I am working with Prof. Di Niu on enhancing Graph Neural Network (GNN) performance and explainability with symbolic and reinforcement learning. Previously I interned at Huawei Research for a year working on hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Outside of research, I enjoy reading and playing the piano. My all-time favorite novel is Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The classic paper by Eugene Wigner "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences" is also a favorite of mine. The pinnacle of human creativity however has to go to Chopin and his Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-Sharp Minor. Currently, I am reading “A New Kind of Science” by Stephen Wolfram which takes a computational view of fundamental physics.
