## Alexander Detkov
Hello, my name is Alex, and I'm currently in the final year of my undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics and Mathematics at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca). I am interested in making deep learning more trustworthy and robust by incorporating symbolic reasoning, interpretability, and inductive biases. I am also very excited about the opportunity to create innovative applications of artificial intelligence (AI) that advance our understanding of the natural sciences. Ultimately, I wish to work and contribute towards a cognitive "System 2" AI.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Di Niu](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dniu/Homepage/Home.html) on enhancing Graph Neural Network (GNN) performance and explainability with symbolic and reinforcement learning. Previously I interned at Huawei Research for a year working on hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Outside of research, I enjoy reading and playing the piano. My all-time favorite novel is Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The classic paper by Eugene Wigner "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences" is also a favorite of mine. Currently, I am reading “A New Kind of Science” by Stephen Wolfram which takes a novel computational perspective on fundamental physics. On the piano I am learning "Fantaisie-Impromptu in C♯ Minor" by Chopin.
